# InvCC - Video Game Economy

This repository contains three versions of the video game Galactic Siege, developed to evaluate different methodologies for balancing internal game economies. The project is part of an academic study on how these methodologies affect player motivation and satisfaction.

## Game Description

Galactic Siege is a space-themed arcade shooter inspired by Space Invaders. The player controls a spaceship that fires automatically in a single upward direction, facing waves of alien enemies. The game includes power-ups such as extra lives and nukes, and is divided into three levels with increasing difficulty.

## Methodologies Evaluated

Each version of the game was balanced using a different methodology:

| Version      | Methodology                        | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Original     | Designer experience                | Intuitive balancing performed by the original creator of the game.          |
| Playtesting  | Focus group playtesting            | Adjustments based on feedback collected from players.                       |
| Mathematical | Genetic algorithm modeling (GEEVO) | Automated balancing using mathematical optimization.                        |
